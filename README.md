# MoodTracker
A pet project: An iOS/ Apple Watch app that regularly asks you how you feel and visualizes your answers over time.

This project is for my personal use. It will be updated regularly as new technologies / tools are published. Anyone is welcome to contribute / clone for personal use.

Currently includes:
- Swift 3.0 syntax
- A basic interface to display your mood over time
- A conventional `UILocalNotification` mechanism
- A notification extension for `UNUserNotification`, which was introduced in iOS 10
- A today extension, which is also used as the *3D peek* of the app
- 3D Touch shortcuts
